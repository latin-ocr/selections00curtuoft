viii SELECTIONS FROM QUINTUS CURTIUS.

he defeated Darius 111 13110 decisive battle of Arbela
(really fought 50 miles from that town, at Gauga-
mela) and entered Babylon (betrayed to him by the
satrap Mazaeus), Susa and Persepolis. The assassin-
ation of Darius by Bessus, the satrap of Bactria, left
the Persian Empire without a head, but there were
still the great Eastcrn provinces to subdue. These
Alexander, after executing Bessus, proceeded to
conquer, and not content with this, invaded India,
defeated and captured Porus, one of the native kings,
and would have attempted the subjugation of the
whole country, had not his soldiers refused to follow
him. Accordingly at the Acesines he had to return
(326), and died at Babylon in 323. Alexander was
a King, General, Soldier, and Explorer, and excellcd
in each capacity. His character was a strange
mixture of virtues and vices. He was adventurous,
brave to rashness‚ profusely generoroe, the idol of his

soldiers. His treatment of the family of Darius, ,
who fell into his hands at Issus, was worthy of the l

age of chivalry. On the other hand he was liable to i

terrible excesses of passion and cruelty. The murder 3
of Clitus, and his revenge upon Betis, the brave j
defender of Gaza, shocked even the not too sensitive ’

Greeks.
